# Task 4️⃣

The goal of this task was to create a virtual machine.

The task consisted of the following steps:
1. Create a VM instance.
2. Get package information from all configured sources (sudo apt update) and install the Apache Web server (sudo apt -y install apache2).
3. Check the status of the Apache server.
4. Remove the preconfigured index.html file.
5. Add my own index.html file.
6. Paste the external IP of the VM to the browser and check if it worked.

The public IP address of my virtual machine isn't included in this repository due to security reasons.
