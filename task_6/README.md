# Task 6️⃣

The goal of this task was to automate the creation and management of resources in GCP.
I had to create a bucket, a virtual machine and a Cloud SQL instance using Terraform.

The task consisted of the following steps:
1. Create a file called main.tf and add configuration of the resources (a bucket, a compute instance, a Cloud SQL instance).
2. Manually change the Cloud SQL instance user's password.
3. Upload the index.html file to the bucket.

Throughout this part of the challenge, I learned:
- how to manage cloud resources through code (Infrastructure as a Code),
- how to automate the creation of resources in the cloud.

Technologies used during the task:
- Terraform
- Compute Engine
- Cloud SQL
- GCS
